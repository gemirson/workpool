# Workpool Architecture

## Overview

The workpool is designed to manage and execute tasks concurrently with high throughput and efficient CPU and memory usage. It follows SOLID principles and evolutionary architecture.

## Components

1. **Task**: Represents a unit of work to be executed.
2. **Worker**: Executes tasks concurrently.
3. **Workpool**: Manages the pool of workers and task queue.
4. **Scheduler**: Handles task prioritization and scheduling.
5. **Notifier**: Handles task completion notifications and error reporting.

## Package Structure

```

```

## Workflow

1. **Task Submission**: Tasks are submitted to the workpool.
2. **Task Scheduling**: The scheduler prioritizes and schedules tasks.
3. **Task Execution**: Workers execute the tasks concurrently.
4. **Task Notification**: The notifier sends notifications upon task completion.
5. **Error Handling**: Errors are handled gracefully and reported.
