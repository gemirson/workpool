# Workpool Project

## Overview

This project implements a high-throughput, CPU and memory-optimized workpool in Go. The design follows software engineering best practices, SOLID principles, and the pillars of evolutionary architecture.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Task Submission**: The workpool should allow tasks to be submitted for execution.
2. **Concurrency**: The workpool should handle multiple tasks concurrently.
3. **Task Prioritization**: The workpool should support prioritizing tasks.
4. **Task Cancellation**: The workpool should allow tasks to be cancelled.
5. **Task Completion Notification**: The workpool should notify when tasks are completed.
6. **Error Handling**: The workpool should handle errors gracefully and provide error reporting.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The workpool should be optimized for high throughput and efficient CPU and memory usage.
2. **Scalability**: The workpool should scale efficiently with the number of tasks and workers.
3. **Reliability**: The workpool should be reliable and handle edge cases gracefully.
4. **Maintainability**: The codebase should be maintainable, following SOLID principles and best practices.
5. **Testability**: The workpool should be thoroughly tested with unit and integration tests.
6. **Documentation**: The project should be well-documented, including code comments and usage instructions.

## Architecture

The workpool is designed with the following components:

1. **Task**: Represents a unit of work to be executed.
2. **Worker**: Executes tasks concurrently.
3. **Workpool**: Manages the pool of workers and task queue.
4. **Scheduler**: Handles task prioritization and scheduling.

## SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component has a single responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Components can be replaced with their subtypes without affecting the system.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Interfaces are specific to client needs.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.

## Evolutionary Architecture

- **Modularity**: The system is composed of loosely coupled, highly cohesive modules.
- **Scalability**: The architecture supports scaling out by adding more workers.
- **Resilience**: The system is designed to handle failures gracefully.

## Usage

### Installation

To install the workpool, run:

```sh
go get github.com/yourusername/workpool
```

### Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/yourusername/workpool"
)

func main() {
    wp := workpool.New(10) // Create a workpool with 10 workers

    task := func() {
        fmt.Println("Task executed")
    }

    wp.Submit(task) // Submit a task to the workpool
    wp.Shutdown()   // Shutdown the workpool
}
```

## Testing

To run the tests, use:

```sh
go test ./...
```
